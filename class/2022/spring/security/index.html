<h2 id="classroom-policies">Classroom Policies</h2>

<h3 id="participation-policy">Participation Policy</h3>

<p>Contribution will account for 5% of your final grade.  Most students will earn 80% of these points.  Students who are exceptional and go above and beyond in enhancing the classroom experience may receive a higher score.</p>

<p>The following list is not comprehensive, but rather an example of items weighted in the contribution category:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing feedback on the class via the course evaluation</li>
  <li>Treating others with respect</li>
  <li>Showing courtesy for presenters (guest speakers, instructor, students)</li>
  <li>Participating in class discussions</li>
  <li>Arriving on time and not leaving early</li>
  <li>Not using technology inappropriately (distracting yourself or others)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="team-work">Team Work and Freeloader Policy</h3>

<p>It occasionally happens in class and organizational settings that someone in a group is not prepared to do their share. In the case of this class, I recommend that the team give the freeloader one warning and then fire that person from the team. That person will then do group assignments individually or find another team to join. The team should notify me of the change in team composition immediately. I will distribute a form to assess team participation at the end of the semester. If a major disparity in team contribution is reported, I will adjust team project grades.</p>

<h3 id="classroom-procedures">Classroom Procedures</h3>

<p>It is all right to use your laptop to take notes, but do not use it for non-class related activities. Not only does this diminish your learning experience, but it distracts those around you.</p>

<p>Out of respect for our guest speakers, do not use electronic devices (e.g., laptops and cell phones) during their presentations. If you want to take notes, please do so on paper.
</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<p>All assignments and projects are to be submitted on time or early, so plan accordingly. If you have to miss class, please submit your assignment early. On VERY rare occasions, an exception may be granted, allowing the student to submit the work late with a 20% penalty. Under no circumstances will anything be accepted more than a week late.</p>

<h1 id="assignments">Assignments</h1>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>

<p>Labs are hands-on learning activities that will be introduced in class and completed outside of class. Labs are typically due one week after they are introduced in class.</p>

<p>You can find instructions for each lab <a href="https://security-assignments.com/beta/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="midterm-vulnerability-assessment-project">Penetration Test Project</h2>

<p>This is a group project. The midterm will be a vulnerability and penetration assessment report of a server. On Tuesday, March 22nd, teams of students will be given an IP address of a server to assess for security weaknesses. The midterm report will be due one week later on Tuesday, March 29th. The report will be written for a management audience.</p>

<p>You can read instructions for the midterm <a href="https://security-assignments.com/beta/projects/pen-test.html/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="current-event-threat-assessment">Current Event Threat Assessment</h2>

<p>This is a group project. Teams will choose a recent security breach incident and report on it as if it just occurred. The report will summarize the incident and give recommendations for how to manage the threat. The report will also include a risk assessment of other potential threats the chosen organization faces, along with recommendations for mitigating each identified threat. Deliverables include a written report.</p>

<p>Assignment description <a href="current_event_threat_assessment/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="readings-quizzes">Readings Quizzes</h2>

<p>Most readings on the schedule have associated quizzes. Quizzes are open book, open Internet and must be completed within 20 minutes. Quizzes are administered on Canvas.</p>

<p>Quizzes are due by the end of the day of the assigned date.</p>

<h2 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h2>

<p>The final exam will be administered via Canvas and will be available to take any time during finals week, May 6–11th. The exam will be open notes, open internet, closed neighbor. You will have two hours to complete the exam. Questions will be mainly multiple choice and will consist of conceptual and practical hands-on questions that draw on the lab assignments.</p>

<h2 id="certification-option">Certification Alternative for Final Exam</h2>

<p>As an option, students seeking certification may replace the final exam by passing the Security+ certification or another certification approved by Dr. Vance. You can substitute your score on the certification (plus an adjustment—5% for the Security+) for the final. For example, if you received an 85% on the Security+ exam you would receive a 90% for your final exam score.</p>

<p>To receive credit for the certification, a student must show evidence of having taken the certification exam by the last day of class (April 29th). If a student doesn’t show Dr. Vance evidence of passing the certification by this date, then he/she will be required to take the final exam.</p>

<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>

<p>You can <strong>replace your lowest quiz score</strong> by watching a third film from the <a href="/security-assignments/security-reading-and-film-list/">Security Readings and Films list</a> and indicate (1) that you watched the whole film, (2) give a brief reaction to the film, and (3) describe how the film relates to the class.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can <strong>replace your lowest lab score</strong> by reading another book from the <a href="/security-assignments/security-reading-and-film-list/">Security Readings and Films list</a> and submitting a few sentences about what you thought about it.</p>
